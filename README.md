# Hygia Sense

### Smart Washroom Monitoring System

---

## 📌 Overview

Hygia Sense is a **Smart Washroom Monitoring System** designed to improve hygiene, transparency, and accountability in public toilets across India.

In most public washrooms, users enter blindly without knowing:

- Which toilet is clean
- Which toilet is occupied
- When it was last cleaned

This often leads to **poor hygiene experiences**, health risks, and serious issues for **women**, who are more vulnerable to infections caused by unhygienic public toilets.

Hygia Sense solves this problem using **real-time monitoring, digital task management, and user feedback**.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Public toilets in India face the following daily challenges:

- No real-time information about toilet cleanliness
- Users unknowingly enter dirty toilets
- No system to monitor cleaner performance
- No accountability for cleaning tasks
- No structured way for users to give feedback
- Authorities lack data to improve sanitation

Due to these issues:

- Hygiene conditions degrade quickly
- Women face higher chances of infections
- Maintenance becomes reactive instead of preventive

---

## 🎯 Motivation

We identified that:

- Cleaning happens without verification
- Complaints are handled only after problems occur
- There is no transparency for users
- There is no digital record of cleanliness

Our goal was to **digitize public washroom management** and provide:

- Transparency to users
- Accountability to cleaners
- Actionable data to authorities

---

## ✅ Solution

Hygia Sense provides a **complete digital solution** by:

- Showing real-time cleanliness and occupancy status
- Monitoring washrooms using sensors
- Assigning and tracking cleaning tasks digitally
